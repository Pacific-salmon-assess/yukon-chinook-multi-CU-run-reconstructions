# yukon-chinook-multi-CU-run-reconstructions

Eventual home of a multi-CU run-reconstruction model that estimates annual population-specific border passage and abundance via a state-space runreconstruction
model fitted to daily estimates of total border passage and population composition from genetic analysis of archive scale and tissue samples. This model draws on past work on Yukon Chinook population diverity [Connors et al. 2022](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2709)
