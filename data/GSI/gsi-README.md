# GSI notes

- samples from eagle gillnet assessment project in 2010 and 2012 do not have julian day assocaited with them, and so should not / cannot be used (identified with a "NO" in the "use" column). There are, however, a smaller number of data assigned samples in these years from the fish wheel assessments. 
- a handful of samples in 2014, 2021, and 2022 that had to have their julian dates estimated based on adjacent samples with known dates. These are identified with a "YES" in the "Estimated_JD" column.
